# tgif-project-vanilla-js
Project of the official page of the Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF) from the united states. In this project I stored a database in
a variable and I made dinamic tables with vanilla Js about the Party Loyalty and attendance of the senators and house of representatives from
USA.
